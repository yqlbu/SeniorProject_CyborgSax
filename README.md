# Project: CyborgSax
Welcome to the CyborgSax

Introduction

This is the GitHub page for the CyborgSax where the team created an attachable device for a saxophone. The need for this device comes from the fact that acoustic instruments have devices that can do audio effects and visual effects. However the saxophone does not have anything tht can display visual effects and audio effects. That is why there is a need for this project where the team is working on building an attachble device that will create visual effects and audio effects. This will give a chance for saxophonists to enchance their live shows.

Requirements

Visual System

LEDs must be attached to the Saxophone.
Consider adding fancy features for the Visual output such as adding a blinking feature on the LEDs. 

Audio System

*Maximum allowed latency of 10ms (The lower, the better)

*Audio Effects is controlled by the microcontroller. DSP will be outputted through the external speaker.

*A sound balancer or a advanced amplifier is needed for the output.

*Microphone sound collection from the saxophone must be done via clip on microphone (Sound input).

*Basic audio effects 

*Processing Unit must be wearable/mountable to the Saxophone.

Power

*The whole system will be powered with a battery pack, no external power source such as power wall outlets is needed for the design except for the audio output (External speaker).

*For the external speaker, it will be connected to wall outlets with a cable.

Current state

Following the customer installation with our client, he wasn’t completely pleased with the product that we gave him. He noted that our audio effects weren’t as good as he had hoped they would be. He also stated that the knobs on our design needed more work and should be more fluid with their movements. To follow up from this customer installation we plan on fine-tuning our audio effects so that they’re acceptable. We will also be working on the fluidity of our knobs.
